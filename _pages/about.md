Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison. 

My research is at the intersection of applied microeconomics and international development.

I received my bachelor’s degree in economics at ITAM (Mexico City) and received a dual master’s degree in Applied Economics and Public Policy at the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor.
